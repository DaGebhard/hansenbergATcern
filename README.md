Collective beam dynamics simulations and instabilities for CERN synchrotrons by college students (Gymnasium Hansenberg)

In our two week internship at CERN we stayed in the “Hadron Synchrotron Coherent effects” (HSC) section. 
This group simulates CERN's accelerators, the particles in it and the interaction of these particles with itself.
After understanding the physics basics we started our own simulations. 
First we simulated the Proton Synchrotron (PS) and learned by this to work with the
Python software [PyHEADTAIL](https://github.com/PyCOMPLETE/PyHEADTAIL) developed by the HSC section
([@PyCOMPLETE](https://github.com/PyCOMPLETE)).
We simulated and generated longitudinal and transverse plots. We also made videos of our simulations.
After that we started to simulate instabilities in the Large Hadron Colider (LHC), which is the largest
circular accelerator worldwide. 
Step by step we approached the real situation in the machine as we added the damper and the octupole
magnets to our machine model.
